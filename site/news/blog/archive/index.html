Its great that they have learned how to create books, include images from the XO camera and post that to the Web. That's not trivial with XO 656! There are also some posts on using eToys to teach geometry. Lastly, I saw a thread on using EToys to create concept maps on our Spanish language list....

That was last November and since then I have spoken with so many interesting people about Etoys and and the Squeakland Foundation. I'm very enthusiastic about our plans.

We've seen it work. Much more is possible. Having spent the last year promoting Etoys on behalf of Waveplace, I'm quite certain that Etoys is ready to take off.

          It was a *lot* of work, but squeakland.org is now available in multiple languages. Currently we support English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. There's much content that needs further translating, particularly for French, but you can see for yourself by changing the language drop-down in the upper-right corner. As a bonus, I've enabled automatic Google translation for project comments and the Squeakers page: http://squeakland.org/squeakers Anyway, we've made a start. If you'd like to add your language to the list, read these two issues and then click "contact" on the website to volunteer: http://tracker.squeakland.org/browse/SQ-481 http://tracker.squeakland.org/browse/SQ-480'&gt; http://tracker.squeakland.org/browse/SQ-480 There are still some spots...

          We had a real backlog of projects waiting to go live on the site. This weekend I tweaked several things and fixed a few bugs, and as a result, a slew of new ballots went out. Now every public project has at least one vote, which means they're all visible. We're up to 102 projects! Quite a selection. Lots of great stuff. http://squeakland.org/showcase/ On a more technical note, I changed the "re-ballot" priority to make things more fair. As ballots expire, projects are picked to get new ballots. Before tonight I favored projects that were the oldest. I've switched...

We started writing the first parts then and met again for an audio call on Tuesday. We had a longer discussion and agreed on the structure now available on the wiki page: http://wiki.squeakland.org/display/sq/Book+Sprint On the other days I had audio chats with Cherry, Randy and Stephen Thomas, mostly about...

         Hello everyone, I'm back from Haiti, both literally and figuratively. Since the earthquake, nearly all of my time has been spent on the seven Etoys pilots that have started or will soon start in four different regions of Haiti. To follow our progress, read the Waveplace blog and see the two videos at http://waveplace.org/news/. We'll be adding a great many photos in the next few days. Connectivity was very bad, so we are only uploading photos now. While it may appear that Haiti has benefitted at the expense of Squeakland so far this year, I think quite the opposite is...
